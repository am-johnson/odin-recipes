        <p>Feel free to substitute your favorite vegetarian or vegan alternatives to make this dish work for you.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Olive Oil</li>
            <li>1 lb Lean Ground Turky Meat</li>
            <li>1 cup Shredded Onions</li>
            <li>1 heaping tbsp Taco Seasoning</li>
            <li>2 cups Cooked Rice (Any type you like - I like to use brown rice)</li>
            <li>3 Bell Peppers, halved and seeds removed</li>
            <li>1 can Black Beans, drained and rinsed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup frozen corn</li>
            <li>1 (15-16 oz) Jar of Salsa (I use peach salsa)</li>
            <li>Shredded Cheese</li>
            <li>Fresh Cilantro</li>
            <li>Sour Cream</li>
            <li>Sliced Avocado</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>Pre heat the oven to 400 degrees. Lightly coat the peppers with
            olive oil and roast in a baking dish about 20-25 minutes just 
            until cooked thru. Remove the peppers from the oven and allow to
            cool until you can handle them.  You can also cook your turkey 
            an sauté your onions at this time.</ol>
        <ol>In a bowl add the taco seasoning, cooked ground turkey, chopped
            onions, black beans, corn and rice. Add in the jar of salsa and
            mix well.</ol>    
        <ol>Carefully spoon the turkey mixture into each half of the bell 
            peppers and place back into the baking dish. Cook the peppers for
            another 15-20 minutes or until the peppers are cooked all the way
            thru. Before removing from the oven sprinkle the tops of each pepper
            with shredded cheddar cheese. Place back into the oven just until the
            cheese has melted.</ol>
        <ol>Remove from the oven and top with fresh cilantro, avocado slices and/or
            sour cream just before serving.</ol>
