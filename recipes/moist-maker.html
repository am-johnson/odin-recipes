        <h3>Ross' favorite post-Thansgiving lunch.</h3>
        <p>Monica makes this for Ross every year.</p>
        <p>Do <strong>NOT</strong> eat Ross' sandwich out of the fridge.  Unless your name is 
            Ross...and that is your sandwich.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 slices of sandwich bread</li>
            <li>Mayonnaise (optional)</li>
            <li>2 pieces of romaine lettuce</li>
            <li>1/2 cup gravy</li>
            <li>1/2 cup left ober turkey or deli-style slices</li>
            <li>1/4 cupped canned cranberry sauce (or homemade if you prefer)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup cornbread stuffing</li>
            <li>salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>Lay out a slice of bread. If using mayonnaise, spread an even 
            layer over the slice of bread then top with a leaf or two of 
            lettuce, then half the turkey, followed by half of the stuffing.</ol>
        <ol>Pour the leftover gravy into a shallow dish. Dip a second slice 
            of bread into the gravy and turn to coat. Top the stuffing with 
            this moist maker slice.</ol>    
        <ol>Add another layer of lettuce, the remaining turkey, cranberry 
            sauce, and top with the rest of the stuffing and the final slice
            of bread. Use a large toothpick to hold everything together.</ol>
